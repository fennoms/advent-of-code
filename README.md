# advent-of-code

This repository contains Python solutions for the Advent of Code problems. The performance of these solutions is not optimal (WIP).

## Directory structure
The directory structure is as follows:

```
advent-of-code/
│
└───YYYY/
    │
    └───DD/
        │   input.txt (ignored)
        │   test.txt (ignored)
        │   solution.py
```

This structure is very important in order to make the script work. The script uses this structure in order to load input and execute the solutions.
